Slicer Execution Model Integration Testing: basic small CLIs to help CLI compatible framework developers check
that their implementation is correct. See [CLI_In_Context](http://www.commontk.org/index.php/CLI_In_Context) on the
CTK wiki for more details.

Depends on [SlicerExecutionModel](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerExecutionModel). The Nifti code was extracted from
the official package found on Sourcforge at [niftilib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftilib/). 

Example nifti data can be found at http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/data.

Yet only tested under Microsoft Windows, compiled with Visual Studio 9 in 32bits.
