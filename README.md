Slicer Execution Model Integration Testing: basic small CLIs to help CLI compatible framework developers check
that their implementation is correct.

Depends on [SlicerExecutionModel](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerExecutionModel).

Yet only tested under Microsoft Windows, compiled with Visual Studio 9 in 32bits.
